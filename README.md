# About Me:
👋 Hi, I’m Adam – nice to meet you

🏆 I’m a Junior DevOps & Cloud Engineer, recently graduated with hands-on experience during a DevOps internship. During this internship, I worked on building and maintaining cloud infrastructure, automating CI/CD pipelines, containerizing applications, and implementing monitoring solutions. I enjoy optimizing workflows and ensuring systems run reliably in real-world environments.

🌱 I’m actively looking for my next opportunity as a Junior DevOps & Cloud Engineer, where I can continue learning and contribute to high-quality, maintainable infrastructure projects.
